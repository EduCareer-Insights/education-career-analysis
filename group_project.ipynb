    "## 1. Project Description\n",
    "This repository focuses on analyzing and modeling an **Education & Career Success** dataset. The dataset examines the relationship between academic performance, skills, and eventual career outcomes (e.g., job offers, salaries, promotions, work-life balance). \n",
    "\n",
    "**Our ultimate goal**\n",
    "To identify the key determinants of career success and develop predictive models that can help students, educators, and career advisors make data-driven decisions regarding academic and extracurricular choices.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Key Objectives\n",
    "- **Data Wrangling & Exploration**: Clean and transform raw data to ensure quality and consistency.\n",
    "- **Descriptive & Statistical Analysis**: Generate summary statistics and infer correlations among features.\n",
    "- **Predictive Modeling**: Build machine learning models to predict job offers, salary range, or career satisfaction.\n",
    "- **Insights & Recommendations**: Provide actionable insights for students and career advisors.\n",
