## 1. Project Description
This repository focuses on analyzing and modeling an **Education & Career Success** dataset. The dataset examines the relationship between academic performance, skills, and eventual career outcomes (e.g., job offers, salaries, promotions, work-life balance). 

**Our ultimate goal**
To identify the key determinants of career success and develop predictive models that can help students, educators, and career advisors make data-driven decisions regarding academic and extracurricular choices.

### Key Objectives
- **Data Wrangling & Exploration**: Clean and transform raw data to ensure quality and consistency.
- **Descriptive & Statistical Analysis**: Generate summary statistics and infer correlations among features.
- **Predictive Modeling**: Build machine learning models to predict job offers, salary range, or career satisfaction.
- **Insights & Recommendations**: Provide actionable insights for students and career advisors.

## 3. About the Dataset

**Name**: Education & Career Success  
**Source**: [Kaggle](https://www.kaggle.com/datasets/adilshamim8/education-and-career-success?resource=download)  
**Records**: ~5000 student entries  
**Use Cases**:  
1. **Predicting Career Success**: Analyze how GPA, internships, and networking influence job offers or salaries.  
2. **Salary Prediction**: Investigate the impact of university ranking, field of study, and certifications on starting salary.  
3. **Skill Importance Analysis**: Determine which skills (soft vs. technical) correlate most strongly with career success.  
4. **Work-Life Balance Insights**: Explore how different career trajectories affect satisfaction and work-life balance.

**Acquisition & Challenges**  
- Downloaded from Kaggle; requires a Kaggle account (free) to access the dataset.  
- Size of the data (~5000 records) is manageable, but care is needed when storing or sharing any personal data.  
- Data is partially cleaned, but further wrangling may be required (e.g., handling missing or invalid values).

## 4. Setup and Installation

1. **Clone the Repository**  
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/EduCareer-Insights/Your_Repo_Name.git
   cd Your_Repo_Name

2. **Create and Activate a Virtual Environment (Optional, but recommended)**
    ```bash
    python3 -m venv venv
    source venv/bin/activate   # macOS/Linux
    # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate

3. **Install Dependencies**
- Check the requirements.txt or environment.yml file for Python dependencies.
    pip install -r requirements.txt
- Typical libraries include pandas, numpy, matplotlib, scikit-learn, etc.

4. **Download the Full Dataset**

- Sign in to Kaggle, navigate to Education & Career Success Dataset, and download education_and_career_success.csv.
- Place the CSV file in the data/ folder (or wherever you prefer) and update paths in the notebooks accordingly.

## 5. Usage

### Data Wrangling
- Open `notebooks/wrangle/wrangle_data.ipynb` and run cells to clean and preprocess the raw data.
- Inspect columns, handle missing values, and perform feature engineering as needed.

### Data Exploration
- Run `notebooks/explore/explore_data.ipynb` to visualize distributions, relationships, and correlations among variables.
- Generate summary statistics and initial observations.

### Modeling
- Execute `notebooks/modeling/model_training.ipynb` to build and evaluate predictive models (e.g., linear regression, random forest, etc.).
- Adjust hyperparameters, compare performance metrics, and select the best model for your goals.

### Results & Insights
- Capture final results (accuracy, R², or other metrics) and interpret them in the context of the research questions.
- Summarize findings and potential next steps in the concluding section of the modeling notebook or in separate documentation.
